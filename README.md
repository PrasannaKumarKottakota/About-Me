# About-Me

Hello!

Myself Prasanna Kumar..

I am Currently working as Project Officer of IC&SR IITM Madras in 6G R&D unit at IIT Madras and pursuing Ph.D under the supervision of Prof. Radha Krishna Gunti. 

I have pursued Integrated M.Tech with a specialization in Communication Technology from Central University of Karnataka (CUK), Gulbarga, I have done my post graduation thesis from Dept. of EE, IIT Hyderabad, under the guidance of  Prof. Md. Zafar Ali Khan.

By working under the guidance of Prof. Zafar, a love towards  Signal Processing in Communication Engineering has developed, which made me good at Matrix Analysis & Linear Algebra, Probability Random Variable & Processes, Digital Communication, Wireless Communication. 

I worked as a Radio Modeling Engineer in Qualcom WLAM PHY Modeling team in Bangalore with Dr. Ashutosh G ( Principal Engineer/ Manage). This experience helped me to gain knowledge ledge Digital Signal Processing in RF Chain, Fixed point arithmetic's and Impairments in the RF Chain.

I worked as a Project Engineer at IISc  5G Testbed under the supervision of Prof. Chandhra R Murthi. During that tenure, I gain knowledge in the 5G NR Physical Layer frame structure by working Open Air Interface 5G stack.

I worked as Project Associate, Sr. Project Assistant in Dept. of EE, IIT Hyderabad under the supervision of Dr. G.V.V.Sharma, which made me develop my skills in Electronic Hardware, especially  radio system development.

My past experience led me to develop research interests in Signal Processing Algorithm Development for Communication Technology and Design of SDR.
